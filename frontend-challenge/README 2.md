# Tennis Court Review - UI Code Challenge
Live App: https://courtly-tennis.vercel.app/
Mobile-first React + TypeScript + Vite app using Tailwind CSS.

## Features
- Mobile-first two-page app
- Search courts by name
- Filter by tags
- View court details and reviews
- Add a review (updates local app state)
- Uses mocked data (60 courts) in `src/mock/courts.ts`

## Setup

1. Install deps:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open in browser (Vite will show the local URL, e.g. http://localhost:5173). App is optimized for a mobile-sized container (max-width 420px).

## Files
Main source: `src/`

## Prompts used with coding assistants (required by challenge)
- I scaffolded a Vite React TypeScript app and created components for a mobile-first tennis court review app. I asked for help writing Tailwind components for search, filter, card, detail, and review form; and for generating mock data for 60 courts.
