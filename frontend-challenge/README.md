UI Code Challenge!

This small assignment will help evaluate your front end development capabilities. You will be evaluated on design choices (friction, scalability, etc), efficient and effective coding, and style.

Challenge

Create a mobile first, two page app for reviewing tennis courts. A user should be able to see a display of courts, search for a specific court, select a court detail view, and leave a review.

Rules

Pull this repo locally and work on your own branch
Maximum time is 4 hours
You will only be evaluated on how it looks on mobile device sizes
No backend, all data will be mocked
You do not need to write tests for this exercise given the time limit
When you are done, submit a PR to this repo.
Hints

Do not use frameworks outside of the JavaScript/Typescript ecosystem
Submissions using React Native are preferred but React, Next, or pure JavaScript are acceptable
Bonus points if you mock > 50 courts as this will let you show off your scalable design skills
You can use coding assistants, but include every prompt you used in your PR
Your job is to delight users
Good luck!
